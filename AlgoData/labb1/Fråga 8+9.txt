8- Arrays are easy and fast to access as they are navigated my indicies
whereas they also have a set length and require memory and time if the 
length of said array need adjustment
Linked data strucres however feature a dynamic size however they are slower as
as they take time to get through the list to the desired node.

In case of large increases to the number of elements to the datastructure
an array will take longer to add those elements as the array need to have its size extended
and contents copied over a large number of times compared to the linked
list would add or remove elements more efficiently and thus the difference may be found.
